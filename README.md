I have currently stopped working on this projcet due to a lack of interest.
However, the game is quite functional.

---------------------------

Game description:
* The player controls a rectangle at the bottom of the screen which shoot
* The goal is to shoot all the falling "enemies", which vary in behavior/size/speed.
* The longer the player stays alive, the larger the score becomes.
* The enemies come in waves, where each successive one increases in speed.
* Each wave features a random set of enemy types and a random color scheme.
* Powerups also fall, which can give the player temporary advantages (e.g. larger shots) or something more permanent (e.g. "health").
* A player's "health" decreases when enemies are missed (or an enemy collides with the player).
* The game ends when the player's health runs out.
* The game is procedurally generated, so each time it's different.

Incomplete features:
* Achievements
* Menu screen
