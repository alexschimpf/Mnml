- achievements
- leveling up - gives you more life
- bosses
- outlined rectangles
- waves change more than just build cooldown
- bonus rounds (after shooting a bonus powerup...)
- disallow bad color combinations and too bright / dark colors

- Use 'final'
- Put constants in their respective classes?

- Create main menu activity
- Create paused popup menu 
- Create game over popup menu
- Save records and settings in shared preferences
- Figure out how powerups are going to look
- Slowly moving, faded, overlapping rectangles in background

--------

- Use observer pattern to make Wave/WaveIntermission communication more intuitive... or NOT!?
	- Run Wave on a thread. When finished, signal to the WaveIntermission observer to begin on its own thread... and so on.
	- Use the following game states: Running, Paused, GameOver
	
- Running update stuff on different threads
	- different threads for each type

--------

- Get rid of FactoryPattern stuff for enemies and stuff
	- make constructors public
	- building random enemy should happen within WaveMachine (keep more of its shit private)

- Penalty should be its own entity (e.g. not powerup and not enemy)

- Powerups should be able to define their durations and keep track of when they expire

- Make ParticleSystem more flexible (parameters for particle duration, speed, number, color)
