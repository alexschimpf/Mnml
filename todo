--------

- Use observer pattern to make Wave/WaveIntermission communication more intuitive... or NOT!?
	- Run Wave on a thread. When finished, signal to the WaveIntermission observer to begin on its own thread... and so on.
	- Use the following game states: Running, Paused, GameOver
	
- Running update stuff on different threads
	- different threads for each type

- Get rid of FactoryPattern stuff for enemies and stuff
	- make constructors public
	- building random enemy should happen within WaveMachine (keep more of its shit private)

- Penalty should be a powerup

- Make ParticleSystem more flexible (parameters for particle duration, speed, number, color)

- Add / remove constants

- Change WaveMachine.currNumEnemiesLeft in done() not update().
	- Works for powerups but not enemies?
	- Problem is that BombPowerup cant call done() on each enemy, or an error occurs.
	- WaveInit in collide?
	- Want to makes enemies emit particles when bomb goes off
